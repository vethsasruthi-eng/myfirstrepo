DEVOPS: 
      devops = development+operations
      developers (who write code)
      operations(who develop/manage systems)
      work together, instead of working in silos 
REALTIME EXAMPLEE:
     the developer writes code to add "track my order" feature
     without devops : developer gives code to Ops team they manually deploy buge happen delays 
     with Devops: code is automatically tested and deployed customers get updates faster and safely 
DEVOPS helps you:
     Release features faster(like adding new payment methods in Zomato)
     fix bugs quickly (like fixing login issue in IRCTC)
     Automate repetitive tasks(like server restarts,database backup)
